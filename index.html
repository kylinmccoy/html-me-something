              <p><h2>Sports</h2></p>
              <p>The love of - nay, addiction to - competitive and solitary sports cuts across all social-economic strata and throughout all the demographics. At least 40 percent of children in the United States play a team sport on a regular basis.</p> <p>Past that age — and even for those who have never played a sport themselves — simply watching college-level, professional and international sports can become a critical part of life. Almost 112 million people watched Super Bowl 50 this February, and it’s predicted that 480,000 tourists will flood Rio for this summer’s Olympics. The sports market in North America alone was worth more than $60 billion in 2014 and is expected to reach $73 billion by year end.</p>

            <h2>Modern Architecture </h2>
            <p> Modern architecture has something for everyone. Even if your taste may veer towards the opposite side of the design spectrum (i.e. rustic country)— there are still elements of modern design that will appeal to you.
            </p><p>The fundamentals of modern architecture are clean and simple. Its ever-present philosophy abides to the ideal that form follows function. Therefore, modern architects express themselves through simplicity, clear views of structural elements and by eschewing unnecessary design details.</p>

            <h2>Travel & Leisure</h2>
            <p>National Parks, pink sand beaches, luxury hotels, different cultures. Wherever your interests lie traveling will assuredly ring the proverbial bell. I love to travel for a number of reasons, but one prime motivator is the chance to escape. Escape what? A demanding job. A bad breakout. The loss of a loved one.People seek from their travels what they don’t have back home: better weather, nicer scenery, the freedom to do what they want, experiences they can’t normally have, a slower relaxing pace. Admiring masterpieces in the Louvre or lying on a Hawaiian beach are wonderful breaks from the regular grind.
            Travel is particularly helpful for workaholics who have trouble leaving their job behind. Stepping away from the workplace is good for you both mentally and physically. <br>When you return to the job, you’ll have had the space to look at issues with fresh eyes.
            Travel has the power to let you not only escape but also heal. A new place with lots of fun distractions can work wonders. You’ll return home more at peace with yourself and your challenging situations. </p>
